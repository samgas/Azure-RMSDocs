# Applications that support Azure Rights Management data protection

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), [Office 365](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf)*


Use the following tables to identify the applications and solutions that natively support the Azure Rights Management service (Azure RMS), which provides the data protection for Azure Information Protection.

For these applications and solutions, Rights Management support is tightly integrated by using the Rights Management APIs to support usage restrictions. These applications and solutions are also known as "RMS-enlightened."

Unless stated otherwise, the supported capabilities apply to both Azure RMS and AD RMS. In addition, AD RMS support on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows Phone 8.1 requires [Active Directory Rights Management Services Mobile Device Extension](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn673574\(v=ws.11\)).

## RMS-enlightened applications

The following table displays RMS-enlightened client applications from Microsoft and software vendors. 

For information about viewing protected PDF documents, see [Protected PDF readers for Microsoft Information Protection](./rms-client/protected-pdf-readers.md).

Information about the table columns:

-   **Email:** The email clients that are listed can protect the email message itself, which automatically protects any attached Office files that are not already protected. In this scenario, the client’s preview feature can display the protected content (message and attachment) to authorized recipients. However, if an email message itself is not protected but the attachment is protected, the client’s preview feature cannot display the protected attachment to authorized recipients. 
    
    Tip: For email clients that don't support protecting emails, consider using [Exchange Online mail flow rules to apply this protection](https://support.office.com/article/define-mail-flow-rules-to-encrypt-email-messages-in-office-365-9b7daf19-d5f2-415b-bc43-a0f5f4a585e8).

-   **Other file types**: Text and image files include files that have a file name extension such as .txt, .xml, .jpg, and .jpeg. These files change their file name extension after they are natively protected by Rights Management, and become read-only. Files that cannot be natively protected have a .pfile file name extension after they are generically protected by Rights Management. For more information, see the [File types supported](./rms-client/client-admin-guide-file-types.md) from the Azure Information Protection client admin guide.

### More information about Azure RMS support for Office

Azure RMS is tightly integrated into the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook apps, where this functionality is often referred to as Information Rights Management (IRM). 

See also: [Office Applications Service Description](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/office-applications-service-description.aspx)

#### Windows computers for Information Rights Management (IRM)

The following Office client suites support protecting files and emails on Windows computers by using the Azure Rights Management service:

- Office apps minimum version 1805, build 9330.2078 from Office 365 Business or Microsoft 365 Business when the user is assigned a license for Azure Rights Management (also known as Azure Information Protection for Office 365)

- Office 365 ProPlus
    
    These editions of Office are included with most but not all Office 365 subscriptions that include data protection from Azure Information Protection. Check your subscription information to see if Office 365 ProPlus is included. You'll also find this information in the [Azure Information Protection datasheet](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf).

- Office Professional Plus 2019

- Office Professional Plus 2016

- Office Professional Plus 2013

- Office Professional Plus 2010 with Service Pack 2

All editions of Office (with the exception of Office 2007) support consuming protected content.

When you use the Azure Rights Management service with Office Professional Plus 2010 and Service Pack 2 or Office Professional 2010 with Service Pack 2:

- Requires the Azure Information Protection client for Windows.

- Not supported on Windows 10.

- Does not support forms-based authentication for federated user accounts. These accounts must use Windows Integrated Authentication.

- Does not support overriding template protection with custom permissions that a user selects with the Azure Information Protection client. In this scenario, the original protection must first be removed before custom permissions can be applied.

#### Mac computers for Information Rights Management (IRM)

The following Office client suites support protecting files and emails on macOS by using Azure RMS:

- Office 365 ProPlus

- Office Standard 2019 for Mac

- Office Standard 2016 for Mac

All editions of Office for Mac 2019 and Office for Mac 2016 support consuming protected content.

### More information about the Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android

The Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android provides a viewer for rights-protected email messages (.rpmsg files) when these mobile devices don't have an email app that can open protected emails. This app can also open rights-protected PDF files, and pictures and text files that are rights-protected.

If your iOS and Android devices are enrolled by Microsoft Intune, users can install the app from the Company Portal and you can manage the app by using Intune's [app protection policies](/intune/app-protection-policies).

For more information about how to use app, see the [FAQ for Microsoft Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android](./rms-client/mobile-app-faq.md).

### More information about the Rights Management sharing app

For Mac computers, the Rights Management sharing app offers a viewer for protected PDF files (.ppdf), protected text images, and generically protected files. It can also protect image files, but not other files. To protect Office files on these computers, use Office for Mac or Office 365 ProPlus.
